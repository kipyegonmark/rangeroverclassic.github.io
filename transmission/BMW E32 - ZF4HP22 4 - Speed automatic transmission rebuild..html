<h1>Rebuilding the ZF4HP22 automatic transmission.</h1>
<p><font color="#FF8080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Problem:</strong></font>
'A' clutch burnout: transmission will not move the car forward or there is a long delay once the car is put into gear.

</p><p><font color="#FF8080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Replacement:</strong></font> Teflon Seal replacement

</p><p>The cause of the problem: the steel seals leak and send pressure to the 1st gear clutch pack and burn it up.
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/seals.jpg">


</p><p>These are the bolts to take out to remove the bell housing and pump as a unit, unless you need to replace the converter bushing <br>you do not need to take the pump apart or off of the bell housing (I will describe the procedure for that and why at the end of the post).
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/bellhbolts.jpg">


</p><p>Here's the bell housing / pump assembly off: 
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/bellpump.jpg">

</p><p>Here's the front of the rest of the tranny and case:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/frontoftranny.jpg">

</p><p>Grab the A-clutch basket and yank it out of the bellhousing / pump assembly:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/aclutch.jpg">

</p><p>Here's the back side of the A-clutch basket, there's a steel bearing surface missing in this pic that you will have - between <br> all rotating parts there's a bearing race (looks like a washer), flat roller bearing and another race:.
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/backofaclutch.jpg">

</p><p>You can leave the shaft in the A-clutch basket or pop it out so the basket will sit flat on a bench; or you can just leave the <br> whole thing in the bellhousing / pump assembly while you do the clutches. There's a spring clip that holds the basket together that you remove with a screwdriver:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/springclip.jpg">

</p><p>Inspect the basket for cracks, I've found a few blown up from people who didn't take no for an answer. Also inspect the groove the <br> spring clip was in: those ears can snap off:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/abasket.jpg">

</p><p>Here's the pack of disks and plates - there's a black wavy disk on the top and bottom of the pack that you re-use:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/aclutches.jpg">

</p><p>This pressure plate is under all of the clutches, you can see some of the burnt clutch on it, clean that off and clean under it:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/pressureplate.jpg">

</p><p>Here's a new disc and steel - soak the discs in fresh ATF for a few minutes before installing:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/clutchplate.jpg">

</p><p>With the teflon seals there should be a drill bit and a sandpaper flap drill thingie - I've never drilled the hole in the 25-30 trannys I've done, it's up to you. <br> It is done to relieve any future leak pressure, I've been doing these for over 5 years and have yet to have one of my repairs fail. <br>The sandpaper drill thingie is used to knock down any burrs left from the steel seals here:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/pumpbore.jpg">

</p><p>New teflon seals. So nice.
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/teflonseals.jpg">

</p><p>Shows the old seals and where to install the new teflon seals. . . 
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/seals.jpg">

</p><p>After cleaning the bore by honing it, stick the input shaft back in the A-clutch basket (if you removed it) and lube the seals and bore with ATF.<br> 
Make sure the three pieces of the bearing are in place and slide the A-clutch assembly back into the bellhousing / pump assembly. <br>It will seat with a thunk and spin freely.

</p><p>Put this bearing race on the of the input shaft/a-clutch assembly, then the bearing and last the other race, it will be the smallest of all the races:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/bearingcap.jpg">

</p><p>Then insert this gear into the A-clutch assembly...
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/gear.jpg">

</p><p>...until it's bottomed out in the clutch pack:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/gearinstalled.jpg">

</p><p>If you didn't break the paper gasket that seals the pump to the tranny you can reuse it as a new one is a bitch to fit onto the pump without ripping it.

</p><p>All that's left is to reinstall the bellhousing / pump assembly into the tranny - get comfy as this can be fun sometimes! <br>The object is to slip the fingers on the back of the A-clutch into the slots of the 2nd gear clutches in the tranny case. Twisting the input shaft helps - you have to 'feel' your way in. <br>There will be no gap between the pump and tranny case when seated. Tighten the 17mm bolts in a cross pattern, and you are done.

</p><p>Take your time: look carefully at how everything came apart, and if in doubt dump ATF all over it if it's inside of the tranny! <br>The Bentley manual has an exploded view of the tranny if I remember right.

</p><p>When installing the torque converter, make sure it's all the way in: If the tranny and motor won't go together find out why, <br>don't pull it together with the bolts as you can destroy the pump and converter.

</p><p>I get most of my parts from these guys, but there's almost always a tranny parts place or two in town.

</p><p><font color="#FF8080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Converter Oil Seal</strong></font>

</p><p>If the converter seal you just replaced is leaking again, the bushing behind the seal has walked forward and is blocking the drain:<br> Time for a new bushing!
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/bushing.jpg">

</p><p>It's hiding here:
</p><p><img src="./BMW E32 - ZF4HP22 4 - Speed automatic transmission rebuild._files/pumpbushing.jpg">

</p><p>Take the bell housing pump assembly off as seen in the a-clutch repair and take the rest of the bolts out of it and separate the pump from the bell housing<br> and take the bolts out of the back of the pump - you can then strip the pump all the way down and press the new bushing in. <br>Reassembly is covered in the A-clutch repair.
