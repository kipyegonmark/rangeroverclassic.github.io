<h1>14CUX Information</h1>

       <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The Lucas 14CUX is an electronic engine management system designed to control fuel injection on the Rover V8 engine. It was used primarily in Land Rover products from its introduction in 1990 until 1995, and also by low-volume sports car manufacturers until the engine ceased production in 2005-2006. More information about the high-level design and applications of the 14CUX can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_14CUX">its Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
        <p>The Rover V8 has a tuning potential that made it popular with specialist sports car builders, and it exists in a variety of configurations from 3.5L to 5.0L displacement and beyond. The fuel maps stored in the 14CUX each represent a two-dimensional array of fueling values, indexed by engine speed and engine load. There are at least two reasons that a person may want to design a custom fuel map:</p>
        <p>(a) The fuel maps are usually specific to a particular engine displacement; a 3.5L fuel map will not work well with a 5.0L engine. Appropriate fuel maps could be used to allow retrofitting the 14CUX system to later Rover V8 configurations -- these may include the 4.0L and 4.6L units, which were sold in the United States with a different engine management system after the 14CUX had been discontinued.</p>
        <p>(b) Engines being tuned for motorsport have different performance requirements than those that were designed for road use. Fuel maps can be modified to increase power at the expense of fuel economy.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to explore and document the internal function of the 14CUX. Exploration of the 14CUX firmware has also uncovered a software protocol that can be used to communicate with the ECU and retrieve diagnostic information over its serial link. (See <a href="http://alum.wpi.edu/~colinb/14cux_interface.html">14CUX Serial Interface</a>)</p>

        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>In Land Rover vehicles, the ECU will have a Land Rover part number starting with either "PRC" (for earlier units) or "AMR" (for later units).</p>
        <p>The microprocessor used by the 14CUX is a Motorola 6803U4, which is an uncommon variation of the 6803. The "U4" has three built-in timers as opposed to the standard 6803's single timer; this is important, as the fuel injectors are batch-fired an entire bank at a time, and each of the left and right banks requires its own timing.</p>
        <p>The code and data is stored in a 27256 PROM, which seems to be soldered in place in earlier (PRC) units and socketed in later units (PRC and AMR). Only half of the 32KB space is used, so the 16KB of code and data is duplicated in the upper half.</p>

        <h3>Memory map</h3>
        <p>The 64KB address space is not fully utilized and some devices are mapped into memory in multiple locations. For example, the 16KB ROM contents appears in $C000-$FFFF, and again in $8000-$BFFF. The four ADC registers repeat from $4000 to $7FFF. If an empty memory location is read, the low byte of the address is returned as the data. (Thus, if displaying a block of memory read from an empty location, it will appear as an incrementing count.)</p>
        <p>The low area of the ROM ($C000-$C83F) contains the fuel maps and other data. The area from $C840 to $FFFF contains code, jump tables, and a few fixed data tables. Code stops around $FA50, and is followed by an unprogrammed section. The unprogrammed area of the ROM continues until near the end, where a vector table is located.</p>

        <h3>Fault bits</h3>
        <p>Fault bits are packed into memory locations $0049 through $004E, as shown below. Shaded cells represent an extended set of fault codes. <b>Update, 2013-12-24:</b> There seems to be a contradiction between the Land Rover documentation and the firmware, with regard to the bank-specific fault codes. I've updated the table below with the correct data. Note that I'm now using the terms 'odd' (cylinders 1-3-5-7) and 'even' (cylinders 2-4-6-8) to differentiate the banks, as this is less ambiguous than left/right or A/B.</p>
