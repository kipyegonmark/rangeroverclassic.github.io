## RAVE

[rave-manual.zip][rave]

This is a 561 MB zip. It's supposed to be run on a Windows system. It won't run
on my Mac. Regardless, it contains all the PDF's for the Defender, Discovery, Range Rover,
RR Classic and Freelander. Just browse the directories to retreive the manual
for you Land Rover. Land Rover stopped producing this in 2003. Newer data is
only available through authorized repairers.
