Discovery (LJ) RA049523 to TA200000
SA500000 to VA557347

Updated information is shown by asterisks.

SITUATION:

OIL PRESSURE SWITCH LEAKAGE

Oil pressure switches on Land Rover vehicles may leak because diaphragm
material within the switch does not meet specifications. This can cause oil
seepage from the switch cap to the body seal, or from the vent hole around the
electrical blade insert.

RESOLUTION:

REPLACE ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION OIL PRESSURE SWITCHES ON AFFECTED VEHICLES

*All vehicles within the above VIN ranges are to be inspected during the next
service visit.*

If the oil pressure switch has not been replaced with either a new style
pressure switch (light gray insert) or with the PRIDE specified switch (black
and red insert), replace the switch with STC4104K.

PARTS INFORMATION:

NOTE: Pressure switch STC4104K is packaged with both a rubber 0-ring (for
serpentine belt vehicles) and a copper washer (for V-belt vehicles).

WARRANTY CLAIMS:

* NOTE: Correct Option 2 time will be automatically selected by LRNA warranty
  computer program based on vehicle upon which procedure has been performed.

CAMPAIGN H483

Option 1 Time 0.10 hrs Inspect vehicle and determine correct oil pressure
switch is installed. Affix campaign sticker.

Option 2 Time 0.55 hrs.  Replace Range Rover oil pressure switch

Option 2 Time 0.45 hrs.  Replace Discovery and Range Rover Classic oil pressure
switch

Option 2 Time 0.30 hrs.  Replace Defender oil pressure switch

All vehicles included in above VIN ranges are to be inspected and oil pressure
switch replaced if indicated by inspection results.*


REPAIR PROCEDURE:

INSPECTION OF VEHICLE OIL PRESSURE SWITCH

1. Inspect oil pressure switch to determine if original switch has been
replaced with correct PRIDE switch (LRNA4641) or H483 Campaign switch
(STC4104K).

2. Identify switch LRNA4641 by the following characteristics:

^ Switch has dark plastic housing with red silicon ring-seal next to the hex of
the switch body.

^ Switch body hex is 11/16 inches.

^ Male spade electrical connection is riveted to housing and the spade is
off-set from center.


3. Identify switch STC4104K which may have been installed from parts stock, by
the following characteristics:

^ Switch has white/light gray plastic housing.

^ Hex is 15/16 inches.

^ Male electrical connector comes through the center of the plastic housing.


*4. If switch is identified as LRNA4641 or STC41O4K, complete campaign sticker
and affix to front cross member. No further action is required.*
