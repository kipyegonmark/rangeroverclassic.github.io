standard tires for new Range Rover Classics were the dual
purpose
Michelin
XMS 244 -- specially developed for the vehicle (<i>see photo
at left</i> depicting author's XMS 244 with a rock penetrating the
tread). The tire was pinned for studs, and its tall, narrow
205R16
size was better suited for use in mud and snow than the wide
"flotation"
sizes used for aggressive looks on most off-road vehicles. The narrow
footprint
sinks through the soft surface to grip the harder surface underneath.
(Of
course, in bottomless mud, nothing works).&nbsp; On the other hand,
these
tires are not optimized for soft sand, so airing down may be needed in
those conditions to increase the ground contact area. All in all, this
design gave remarkable all-round performance. In 1991, the Hunter model
came with 205R16 Goodyear Wrangler tires -- also a dual purpose design.
These still show up occasionally -- for example a shipment came into
Atlantic British in 2004. <img alt="xpc" src="./Range Rover Classic Tire Choices_files/xpc2classic.JPG" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 304px; height: 409px;" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20"> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">In 1995-6 the XMS 244 was superseded by a new, more highway-biased
Michelin
design, the 4X4
XPC -- the same tire used on the Discovery and 4.0SE, but in the
narrower
205-80-R16 size. According to Michelin advertisements, this tire has
better
wet pavement grip than the old tire, and a 40% greater contact area.
Most
users find it to be quieter and smoother riding than the old 244, and a
superb tire on pavement, rocks, sand and snow. Visually, the tread
looks
less aggressive, and is 3/4 inch wider than the old design. Not
surprisingly,
therefore, most users agree that the tradeoff for all these benefits
shows
up in reduced mud performance. <b><font size="-1">(Photo at right:
Michelin 4X4
XPC)</font></b> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">When I got my Classic, new XMS 244s cost almost $200 each, but Paul
B, tire center manager at Costco in Colorado reported(2001) the
205/80R16
was then available for $111 ($120.99 installed) at Costco. Michelin has
since discontinued production of the XPC in this size and replaced it
with an extremely wimpy pavement-only tire called the Synchrone. <br>

<a name="other205"></a><font size="+2">Other 205-R16 Tire Choices</font> </font>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">In the US, the range of tires available in the <b>205 R16</b> size
is
limited. An exception is a new Continental 4x4 Contact tire recently
sourced by&nbsp;<a href="http://click.websitegear.com/track.asp?id=365">Atlantic
British</a> and available form them individually or in <span style="font-weight: bold;">sets of four for</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">$539</span> -- pretty much a record for
Range Rover tires!! Another option is the <a href="http://www.coopertires.com/tire_cooper/ltsuv.asp?id=174">Cooper
Discoverer Radial</a>, with an all-terrain tread design similar to the
stock Michelins.&nbsp; Avon tires (optional on new Rovers in the UK),
are
also now available in the US through Cooper dealers due to the recent
takeover
of Avon by Cooper. The 215-75-R16 Avon
Rangemaster radial, with its narrow, aggressive tread, was offered
as an option on Range Rovers when fuel injection was introduced in
1986,
and has done very well in off road tire tests. However this seems to be
no longer available in the US. The less
aggressive
205-R16 <a href="http://www.avontyres.com/4x4.asp?id=152">Rangemaster
CR34</a>
looks like a cross between the Michelin designs and a Goodyear Wrangler
AT. It was still available last time I looked in August 2003. The 205
R16&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nokiantires.com/html/hakka10C.html#top">Nokian
Hakkapeliitta 10 C</a>, a specialized snow tire, is available through
suppliers
like&nbsp;<a href="http://click.websitegear.com/track.asp?id=365">Atlantic
British</a>. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">In the UK, many other 205-R16 tires can be obtained. Those with mild
treads similar to the OEM tires include the Goodyear Wrangler (original
equipment on the 1991 US Range Rover Hunter), <a href="http://www.bfgoodrichtires.com/catalog/rad_longtrail_ta.html">BF
Goodrich Long Trail</a> and <a href="http://www.generaltire.com/tire_detail.cfm?tire_name=GRABBER+AP">General
Grabber AP</a>. Slightly more aggressive is the Falken 235 All-Terrain.
Some very aggressive mud tires in the 205 R16 size are available from
Simmonites
in Bradford, including the "Satanik" and the "Super Trak". Retreads are
available in both road and mud patterns. </font>

(225/75,

<p><font face="Segoe UI">Because of the difficulty of obtaining most 205-R16 tires in the US,
many tire dealers list the <b>225-75-R16</b> size as an
almost-equivalent
alternative. The diameter of these tires is very slightly larger than
the
29 inch 205-R16, while the cross section is very slightly wider. A vast
array of tread patterns from mild to extremely aggressive is available
in this size. Some of the better known All Terrain and Mud Terrain
designs

and the new <a href="http://www.yokohamatire.com/">Yokohama

decide what tread pattern is best for his particular vehicle use. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">A tire of the same diameter as the stock 205/80R16 (but slightly
wider)
is the Michelin XPC 4X4 <b>235/70R16</b> used on the Discovery (see <small><font size="+1"><small><a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=37919709&siteid=40278193&bfpage=tires" target="_top">The Tire Rack</a></small></font></small> for details). Derek Brennan uses this
size on his LWB, and Mike Mallers
uses it in a BFG AT KO. Both confirm that there is no problem of
rubbing. <br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">A more pavement-oriented choice is the new Michelin Cross-Terrain,
designed for "the way most Americans use their SUV's" (ie no off road
use). Ben Bailey reports
these tires (which he tried in the 235-70-R16 size) give an
exceptionaly quiiet and good andling ride on te pavement. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><a name="wider"></a><font size="+2">Wider Tires (255/65R16)</font>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">The Classic was designed for narrow tires, but some have had success
using wider ones. Niall
Sommerville
has used Grabber A/P <b>255/65/R16</b>s and found them to be good on
pavement
and quite reasonable off road in the dry, losing about 15% lock. He
also
tried Pirelli Scorpion II 255/65/16s, finding them very good on road
and
quite impressive in the wet, with a slight tendency to aqua plane in
very
heavy surface water (same as most road patterns). They caused a 10%
loss
of lock. Graham TerMarsh found the 255/65 Yokohama ATs that came on his
used LWB rubbed seriously on tight turns. So, if you use this wider
size
intended for the 4.0/4.6, adjustment of your steering stops is probably
advisable. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><a name="large"></a><font size="+2">Larger Tires: 30-31" Diameter
(245/70,
215/85, 245/75, 31x10.5)</font> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">It is traditional in the four wheeling world to increase ground
clearance
by fitting larger-than-stock tires. In the US sizing&nbsp; system, the
most common "upgrade" off-road tire for SUVs is the "31", or
31x10.5R15,
usually about 30.6 inches in actual diameter -- about 1.6 inches larger
than stock Range Rover tires. Most of the following choices have
roughly
the same diameter as "31's", but are narrower. Most of these options
seem
to work without necessitating other changes like suspension lifts. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">245/70R16</font></b>
<br>
A few millimeters taller than the 225/75R16, and a bit wider, is the
<b>245/70R16.
</b>Gregg
Feldman uses
<a href="http://pirelli.pearlcomm.com/pneumatici/prodotti/cat/catric/scorat.htm">Pirelli
Scorpion ATs</a> of this size on his 1988 Range Rover. He has OME MD
springs.
He loves them, experiences no rubbing, gets a great ride wet or dry,
and
their performance off road has never let him down. However, Jay
Corbett tried 245/70/16 BFG All-Terrains on his RR with Old Man Emu
springs (about 1.5 inches of lift). He found plenty of room for the
tire's
height, but the width caused rubbing on the strut on the inside of the
wheel well, limiting the turning radius of the tire. (Preventing the
rubbing
would require adjustment of the steering stops). He also found the
spare
of this size would not fit inside the carrying space. He also rightly
observes
that any tire sizes larger than stock will have some effect on braking
and speedometer settings. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">215/85 R16</font></b>
<br>
This size requires no body, suspension or even steering stop
modifications.
Interestingly, dimensions are almost identical to the 700-16's used on
Camel Trophy vehicles for many years, and the width is similar to the
stock
Range Rover tires. It yields close to an inch of extra static clearance
under the diffs, with a slight gearing penalty of 3-4% at highway
speeds.
A range of tread patterns is available in this size, mainly designed
for
commercial truck use. Examples include the Dunlop
RT, the BF
Goodrich Trac Edge, and the <a href="http://www.bigo.com/default.asp?id=201">Big
O XT</a>. <b><font size="-1">(Photo: Dunlop Radial Rover RT,

</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">George Bull and Granville
Pool use BF Goodrich Trac Edges in this size on their 87 and 92
Range
Rovers. Keith Armstrong uses the Dunlop RT on his Discovery.&nbsp; I
used
the 215/85R16 Dunlop RT on my 89 Range Rover Classic. All users report
better traction and clearance off road. I did find the tall narrow size
adversely affected dynamic steering response and handling though. I
recommend
making sure your suspension bushings are new and in excellent shape if
you use this tire size, as any extra slop can make the oversteer rather
scary. Tim Hart&nbsp; found that
215-85-R16 Michelin LTX ATs led to enough oversteer and sway on his 84
Range Rover that he removed them. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">245/75 R16</font></b>
<br>
This is the same diameter but wider&nbsp; than the 215/85.
Unfortunately
most 245/75s are rated load range E (ie 10 ply), which may give more
road
"feel" going over small bumps. Exceptions, available in Load Range C,
are
the Dunlop
Radial Rover RV (an all-terrain) and the Firestone Destination MT, a
mud tire.&nbsp; John
Lewis, Peter Bradley
and
others have reported that 245/75s cause&nbsp; minimal or no rubbing at
full articulation if the steering stops are adjusted. Exact room to
spare
depends on brand and style; John Lewis reports no rubbing with BFG ATs
at full articulation, with adjusted stops and a moderate lift (OME
springs),
but observed that MTs rubbed on other vehicles he saw. He reports the
upside
is the extra ground clearance, and extra width to get through soft sand
and protect the rims a bit more. The downside is the slightly decreased
acceleration from the larger diameter, and a harsher ride from the
stiff
sidewalls and extra unsprung weight. (there may also be little room for
snow chains). Others have found no problems with certain brands of
245/75
on bone stock Range Rovers. For example, Tad
Helms reports excellent results with his Firestone Firehawk RMTs. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">31x10.5 R15</font></b>
<br>
The traditional 31 inch tire under the US "flotation" tire sizing
system
is the 31x10.5R15. For these of course you need to obtain a set of 15
inch
rims that will fit the Range Rover bolt pattern, and the wider
footprint
of the tire compared with those above may call for some sheet metal
mods
and/or suspension lift to avoid rubbing at full articulation. Michael
Slade has installed 31x10.5R15 Super Swampers on his 1990 Range
Rover
using an OME 2 inch lift and some fender cutting. He has an excellent
description
of how he did it at <a href="http://www.dreamlab.cc/swampers.html">this
link</a>. </font>

<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">The next step up in size is to about 31.5-32 inches in diameter,
about
10% more than stock. This is getting up to the size where some kind of
modification to the suspension (a moderate lift) or the body (fender
trimming) is usually needed to avoid rubbing at full articulation. For
illustrated details of this procedure, see the <a href="http://www.rangerovers.net/rrupgrades/trimarches/index.html">fender trimming page</a>.&nbsp;

</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">7.50-16</font></b>
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="mailto:andyg@sherco.co.za">Andy Grafton</a>
has done <a href="http://users.iafrica.com/b/br/brantxit/rock1.html">extensive
testing with the <b>7.50-16</b></a>; about the same 32 inch diameter
as
a 235/85 but narrower. He has used Michelin XCL mud tires in this size
on his 1979 2-door Range Rover with standard shocks and springs. He
used
Discovery wheels, which he says are slightly more inset. With the
steering
stops adjusted, there was no rubbing on the bodywork at all, even under
complete articulation and full lock. The middle tread of the tyres
touched
the top of the rear wheel wells on full articulation when the tyres
were
new but once they lost a few mm of tread they clear all round.&nbsp;
When
the tyres are covered in mud the bodywork sounds like it is scraping a
little, as there are only a couple of millimetres between metal and
tyre,
and the mud gets noisy in the gap. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">Subsequently, Andy lifted his suspension two inches by using longer
springs&nbsp; (articulation appears unchanged but he is riding 2"
higher
on the shocks). He now uses, as his everyday tire, the 7.50R16 General
SAG Radials (mild tread). However he recently tried a set of serious
mud
tyres on loan; General SAG crossplies, similar to Firestone SAT with
big
lugs and massive tread.&nbsp; On Disco steel rims they rubbed the
inside
of the fenders/chassis at the front somewhere and the tyres got
damaged.&nbsp;
The solution was to use 5.5" wide rims from a standard Land Rover 109.
The tires required a lot of steering stop adjustment but now, Andy
reports,
"they don't rub and boy do they grip!" </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">235-85-R16</font></b>
<br>
This is a tall, relatively narrow tire and has been found variously
to fit or rub according to exact dimensions which vary from brand to
brand.
<u>Without
a lift</u>, fit is marginal. Larry
Michelon&nbsp;
runs 235/85s (Cooper Traction RLTs) and found they only contact the
forward
lip of the rear wheel well. Steve
Williams
had BFG MT's in 235/85/16 and they rubbed so much they started to bow
the
entire side of the car out. In everyday driving there was no rubbing,
but
in extreme situations it sounded like an Uzi going off. He observed on
a friend's RR that trimming the inside lip of the wheel wells helped
considerably. Andy
Grafton tried 235/85 Conti Tracs but found that although they are
the
same diameter as the 7.50s they are considerably wider at the tread and
interfere with the front&nbsp; and inner fenders on full lock and full
articulation. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><u>With a 2 inch lift</u> (eg OME heavy duty springs) the 235s
usually
fit but some minor fender bending may still be needed depending on the
specific tire and setup used. Rick
Raile fitted 235/85R16s after adding OME springs, Bilstein shocks
and
"adjusting" his spare tire well with an 8 lb sledge. David
Sherwood found that his 2" Medium Duty Emu springs work well with
the
235/85 R16 BFG MT on his 88 RR. (As in other sizes, the BFG MTs are
actually
a little larger than some of the other 235/85s, such as
Generals).&nbsp;
David fitted Safari Gard bumpstops, folded back the body work at the
bottom
of the rear door, and adjusted the steering stops. He still gets a
little
rubbing in the back under FULL articulation, but it is only on the
smooth
surface of the wheel well. He reports: "I would highly recommend the
235/85
vs the 245/65 as the extra clearance has made me able to go through
obstacles
that a Rangie with 245/65s and dual lockers got hung up on...".&nbsp; Chadd
Montgomery has 235/85 ATs on his 87 RR with an OME MD suspension
lift.
He reports that "they fit very well and only rub when turning very
sharply
to the left. I now have about 10 inches of clearance under the
differentials."
He also reports that the 235/85s noticeably softened the ride over
small
bumps compared with 225/75R16 tires he used previously. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">265/75R16</font></b>
<br>
The 265/75R16 is marginally smaller in diameter than the 235/85 but
considerably wider. James
Cirbus
has fitted 265-75R16&nbsp;<small><big><a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=37919709&siteid=40278193&bfpage=468x60_bf_goodrich" target="_top">BF Goodrich M/T tires</a></big></small> in conjunction
with the tallest available Old Man Emu
lift, and reports no problems except a reduction in steering self
centering.
Before and after <a href="http://www.iwaynet.net/~jcirbo/and3.htm">pictures</a>
of his conversion can be seen on his website. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">In these sizes conventional wisdom would suggest that a change in
differential
gears would be desirable. However Larry
Michelon found his highway gas mileage actually improved versus his
former OEM 205/80 tires. Around town mileage appeared to drop, but he
didn't
have a before and after comparison. Driving through the mountains of
PA,
WV and VA on a recent trip, he did not find the power loss to be a
problem. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI"><b><font size="+1">32/10.5R15</font></b>
<br>
15 inch tire sizes are most popular with the 4x4 community in the US,
and many choices are available. To use these tires on a RR you have to
get special 15 inch rims, available from suppliers such as SafariGard
or
Gulf Coast Rovers. Bob Koly has
pictures
of his 89 Range Rover with 32x10.5R15 (he ordered American Racing
rims&nbsp;
from gulfcoastrovers.com - Alan and Mimi Dobbs - $50 a piece) - at <a href="http://www.koly.com/kolanders/rangerover">this
link.</a>&nbsp; He had to do two rounds of trimming&nbsp; -- see
pictures. However he was
surprised
at how well the 10.5's fit into the wheel well. He found that handling
stayed very similar, but the truck floats a little more with these
large
tires on smaller wheels. Acceleration is noticeably reduced, and low
gear
is noticeably higher. He is thinking of installing lower gearing, new
axles,

<p><font face="Segoe UI">On the topic of 32 inch tires, Larry
Michelon comments "A 32x10.5 is not 32" tall, so you won't run into
any height problems. They are probably closer to 31.5". They will be
wider
than both these sizes.&nbsp; Having 235/85's myself and seeing many
265/75's,
I would bet you're going to run into problems with inner fender lips on
the forward edge of the rear wheel wells (I hope that made sense). This
lip can be folded flat for clearance (this should be enough). You'll
have
to adjust you're turn stops to keep them from hitting the radius arms".

</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">The fitment of "33s" will definitely require both a moderate lift
and some trimming of the fenders. For illustrated details of the latter
procedure, see the <a href="http://www.rangerovers.net/rrupgrades/trimarches/index.html">fender
trimming page</a>. Tires even larger than 33's can lead to a chain
reaction of
suspension
and body lifts, lower gears, steeper drive shaft angles with more
vibration,
and more strain on the drive train, with more likelihood of breakages.
Hence the need for heavier axles and drive train parts, axle trusses,
heavier
shocks, etc. Ironically, some of these mods, (eg axle trusses), can
reduce
the useful ground clearance which was the original reason for the
project!
Those wanting substantially larger tires should look at the complete
picture
to achieve the desired clearance, strength, performance and safety.<img src="./Range Rover Classic Tire Choices_files/Rover-Home2.jpg" alt="Dave Brown&#39;s Monster Tires" align="right" height="243" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="359"> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">Dave Brown, a true pioneer
in
Range Roverdom, is working on such a build-up. He has Old Man Emu heavy
duty springs and Bilstein shocks front and rear. The tires are <b>255/85R16</b>
(33.6" tall) Dunlop
Radial Mud Rovers.&nbsp; As the <b>picture </b>shows, tire
rotation
folded part of the fender upwards behind the front tire, so the plastic
sill under the doors is now too long. Dave plans a steel one, 2" to 3"
shorter than stock, doubling as an air tank. The front tire only rubbed
slightly on the front of the fender, so Dave bent it slightly outwards
(from "(" to "|" ).&nbsp; He plans to get an ARB or equivalent bumper,
and trim off the lower front 4" of the fender, where the stock end caps
normally go. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">The rear wheel well was notched to allow articulation. No rubbing
occurred
until the tires try to tuck into the wheel well, when they rub at the
front
of the rear tire.&nbsp; Dave trimmed the lower INSIDE lip of the door,
where the short piece of weather-stripping was (this stripping is only
a dust seal and doesn't affect the water seal). He also cut a "notch"
in
the door frame, and folded the edge over to facilitate
articulation.&nbsp;
None of this is visible from the outside (even when the door is open
unless
you're looking for it).&nbsp; It still rubs a little under heavy
articulation,
so a bit more work is needed. Dave thinks his ultimate solution will be
raising the body by 1" to 2".&nbsp; As an alternative, he is thinking
about
first making blocks to put underneath the lower spring mounts. The
downside
is that this will raise the center of gravity, and increase the drive
line
angles.&nbsp; On the plus side, it's dirt cheap!<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">Ian Matthews felt
Dave's low cost tire fitting job a bit rough and ready, so he produced
the rather neat installation at the top of this page.
He reports: "The springs are Land Rover, but spring weights and lengths
have been selected to give a 2 inch spring lift and a 2 inch body lift
has also been added. The front and rear guards and doors have been cut
and replaced with fibreglass flares. The tires in the photo are
255/85/16 BFG M/Ts on fully reversed 16x7 Discovery rims. I have large
amounts of articulation on all wheels and one just touches the flare on
the drivers side rear door." He liked the extra stability the reversed
wheel arrangement provided, as well as the fact it helped to fend off
rocks!&nbsp; Ian subsequently modified his setup and
now has 33x10.5x15 Simex Jungle Trekker 2 tires fitted to 15x8 rims. He
reports they do not hit the flares at all as the rims are slightly more
towards the centre of the vehicle (10mm).&nbsp; The flares are supplied
by lrautomotive.com.au, who make flares for Range Rovers and Discoverys
that are available for shipment overseas.<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">Allison van der Kooi&nbsp;
put 33 inch Baja Claws on. He reports "I have fitted a 2 in body lift
and added 2 in to the springs. I had to trim the wheel arches as the
first trip to the mud I found the tyres to be hitting on the back of
the front arch and on the front of the rear arch, they are all clear
now, The only problem I have now is the tyre's&nbsp; rub on the radius
arms when at full lock. the only way I can see to stop this is to off
set my rims. My current rims are 15 x 8 ROH steal wheels that look a
wide version off an old Landrover rim." </font>

<font face="Segoe UI">
<a name="iuse"></a><font size="+2">What Do I Use?</font> </font>
<p><font face="Segoe UI">On my Classic Range Rover I started with the stock Michelin XMS244
tires,
replacing them with the Michelin 4X4 XPC when it came out. The latter
was
exceptionally smooth riding and grippy on the pavement, and seemed less
easily destroyed by rocks. However it inspired reduced confidence in
the
mud, so I switched to the Dunlop
Radial Rover RT in the 215/85 R16 size. I was choosing between the
215/85 and the 245/75, but found that most tires more aggressive than
an
A/T in the 245/75 size were only available in Load Range E.&nbsp; This
makes for a fairly heavy and stiff riding tire. (I since found out
about
the <a href="http://www.firestone-usa.com/products/fsfhrmt.htm">Firestone
RMT</a> which is load range C in the 245/75 size&nbsp; -- well worth
considering
for those looking for a mud tire). The 215/85 BFG Trac Edge and Dunlop
RT are a good deal more aggressive than all-terrains, but are available
in Load Range D. The RT design is amazingly quiet for its
aggressiveness.
Still, on the highway, the ride over small bumps is not quite as silky
smooth as with the stock Michelins, and there is a slight handling
penalty
due to the taller tire profile.<br>
