My current tire size: P225/75R16

![todgru's 1992 RRC](../images/todgru-1992-rrc-stock.png)

I like the tall, narrow tire look on the RRC. A tire with added sidewall
support to allow for tire deflation when off road would be nice.  The BFG AT
235/85R16 looks good, but I might lean towards a 225 or a 215 width.  Costco
has a good deal on [BFG All Terrain TA KO2 LT235/85R16](http://costco.com) for
$174.99.

Likely the best resource for RRC tire information: http://www.rangerovers.net/outfitting/tires/classictires.html

From RangeRovers.net: "215/85 R16 
This size requires no body, suspension or even steering stop modifications.
Interestingly, dimensions are almost identical to the 700-16's used on Camel
Trophy vehicles for many years, and the width is similar to the stock Range
Rover tires. It yields close to an inch of extra static clearance under the
diffs, with a slight gearing penalty of 3-4% at highway speeds."
